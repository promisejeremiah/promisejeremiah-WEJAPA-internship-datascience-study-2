#You're going to create a list of the actors who appeared in the television programme Monty Python's Flying Circus.

#Write a function called create_cast_list that takes a filename as input and returns a list of actors' names. It will be run on the file flying_circus_cast.txt (this information was collected from imdb.com). Each line of that file consists of an actor's name, a comma, and then some (messy) information about roles they played in the programme. You'll need to extract only the name and add it to a list. You might use the .split() method to process each line.

def create_cast_list(filename):
    cast_list = []
    #use with to open the file filename
    #use the for loop syntax to process each line
    #and add the actor name to cast_list

    
    with open('flying_circus_cast.txt') as f:
        for actor in f:
            actor_name = actor.split(',')
            cast_list.append(actor_name[0])
            
    return cast_list

print(create_cast_list('flying_circus_cast.txt'))
